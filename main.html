			Hi again,
			<br>
			So the first time I was exposed to programming would be my first year at college, and I would have to say it's the best thing I have ever learned. What I found the most fascinating about programming is the ability to create what you want. Originally I had started working with object oriented programming languages such as C++ and Java, and it was mainly on school related projects. The summer after graduating from Rutgers University with a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering, I had decided to collaborate with my friend on a web development project that she joined with her professor. Of course I wasn't very familiar with web development, well to be honest I didn't know anything. Since it was something new for me I really thought it would help enhance my skills as a developer.
			<br>
			<br>
			Right after graduating I had some conflicting decisions to make, especially answering the most daunting question, What do you want to do after graduating? Of course ever since I started programming I knew I wanted to have a career in development. The question was, Developing what? But after exposing myself to web development that summer I had finally realized my passion in life, and that was designing and developing websites. So now I'm currently attending a course called Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in order to enhance my skills as a web developer. But I wont stop there, thereâ€™s always something new to learn.
			<br>
			<br>
			Well, that's enough about that. When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing Dragon Age: Inquisition which seems to be an endless game. As well as watching shows online or drawing. Also browsing the web to learn the latest techniques in order to provide the best quality in user experience.

		<h4 class="headeralignment">Career Objectives</h4>
		<p>
			Im always looking to learn new things in web development so I can implement them on a later project. So that is my first career objective, being able to learn as much as I can from where ever or from whomever is willing to teach me. After learning all I can, then I would love to create the best website in the world. The best anyone has ever seen...I know very ambitious, but a girl could dream. In all seriousness I would just love to create websites where people love to visit everyday.
