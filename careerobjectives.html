	<h1>Career Objective</h1>
	<p>
		Im always looking to learn new things in web development so I can implement them on a later project. So that is my first career objective, being able to learn as much as I can from where ever or from whomever is willing to teach me. After learning all I can, then I would love to create the best website in the world. The best anyone has ever seen...I know very ambitious, but a girl could dream. In all seriousness I would just love to create websites where people love to visit everyday.
